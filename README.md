# Smart Traffic Light
Every Saturday I work in a russian gimnasium (for bilingual children) as a teacher for robototechnics.
I thought making and an arduino project would be fun. I decided to make an traffic light with arduino. Recently I've ordered microcontrollers D1 R1 mini (ESP12F) for my students, so we gonna use them for our project when I'll get them.
To do not waste time during the course we will begin with Arduino Uno, this microcontroller is preinstalled in Arduino IDE, so we don't need to download extra libraries and will start imediately. All our work can be easily swirched to most of any controllers. 
My students are to young, so I'll not theach them functions, cicles for, object orintated programming and other cool stuff, but maybe I'll have them in different branches.  I hope they will like it and growe their skill quicke so we can contine our courses with microPython, STM32CubeIDE, or CMake.

Navigation of the project:
1. 'master' main branch
2. 'explain' will be used during the course. Students can see this code on the blackboard and work in theirs IDEs.
3. 'target' demonstration of the program they should make  

## First lesson:
We are learning how to turn and on and turn off LEDs.
Learning how to blink them (delay in executing program). 
Objectif: making a simple program to controll three LEDs. Turninig them on in sequence like an real traffic light.
